1. Excel: Using Excel formulas to calculate the key metrics.
2. Pivot table: where the project is summarised in an understandable manner.
3. SQL: where queries are written and validated to extract key insights.
4. Power BI: This is used for data visualization of the insights found in Excel & SQL.

### Inference

- Sales Overview: It was deduced that the sales decline in Year 2024 with N562,500 lower than the revenue for the year 2023. There are many factors that might have caused the decline in revenue, it can be that there was a change in customer taste, rise of competition and this has to be addressed by having sales promotion and avertisement to increase the revenue.

- Top performing products: By using the exel & SQL, the product "Shoes" was considered to be the top performing product base on the total revenue it generated which is higher than the other products.

- Regional Breakdown:
  1. East: In Year 2023, the total revenue generated was N1,987,500. However, there was a significant decline in 2024 with the total revenue coming down to N462,500 representing 62% decrease. This all in revenue may suggest increase in competitors and/or market contraction. This indicate a potential area of concern which requires immediate attention.
  2. North: There was a notable increase in the total turnover from N725,000 in Year 2023 to N1,225,000 in Year 2024 with 26% increase. The company should invest more products in this region to better boost the total revenue.
  3. South: This region also performs well in generating revenue to the company. However, there was a slight decrease in revenue generated as decrease of N175,000 was recorded representing 4% decrease. Thisis not a major challenge but the reason for the drop in revenue have to be investigate so as to maintan/increase the revenue in a subsequent year.
  4. West: There is a significant increase in the revenue recorded in this region as N637,500 increase was recorded in between 2023 & 2024. It might be that the company is a monopoly. This need to be maintain for the region to keep on recording increase in revenue.
